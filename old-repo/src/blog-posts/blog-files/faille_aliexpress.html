      <h2>Signing up</h2>
      <p>When you sign up on Aliexpress you are asked for an email and a password or something like a google account.
Using a google account is safer in the way that your payment is more likely to go through. However, I have found an easy workaround: disposable email services (e.g. <a href="https://www.mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp">mailinator</a>)
On these types of services it is possible to create an email address without a password, by just typing it it.

      <h2>Paying</h2>
      <p>It is important that you do not use the same payment method more than 2-3 times in the same month.
The same goes with the address of delivery but here it needs to be different every time. Now, instead of changing the whole address you can simply change it by adding small typos, or double letters, or putting a special character that looks like the original character. It just needs to be a different string on each payment, that is all the algorithm looks for. The actual address will be read by a human, not a computer.</p>
      <p>Note: In some countries it may seem that you cannot write small typos into the address because there is a pop up menu that autocompletes it, just ignore it, you can still write typos.</p>
