    <h2>Getting the email address</h2>
    <p>When you sign up on Aliexpress you are asked for an email and a password, or something like a google account.
Using a google account is safer in the way that you are less likely to get declined when doing a purchase. However, I have found an easy workaround: disposable email services (e.g. <a href="https://www.mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp">mailinator</a>)
On these types of services it is possible to create an email address without a password, by just typing it it.
